# EHRLICH (Medical Expert System)
**E**n**h**anced **R**ule- and **L**ogic-Based **I**mmunological **C**onsultative **H**ub or **EHRLICH**, a reverse acronym inspired by the German pioneer of immunology Paul Ehrlich, is a medical expert system specializing in autoimmune diseases, conditions that are triggered by malfunctions of the immune system that cause it to attack healthy body tissues. In particular, its goal is to automate the diagnosis for 15 such diseases, selected on the basis of their prevalence and the accessibility of symptomatic detection with visual inspection or the patient’s own assessment prior to conclusive laboratory tests.

***DISCLAIMER: The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of employing backward chaining in the implementation of medical expert systems that are able to handle uncertainty. Although care has been taken to consult technical sources, this system is ultimately subject to a closed-world assumption and to the limited size of its knowledge base.***

***Therefore, it is NOT intended to be used for real-world or professional diagnosis.***

## Task
The 15 autoimmune diseases included in the knowledge base of this project are as follows: Addison disease, dermatomyositis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, Grave’s disease, myasthenia gravis, pernicious anemia, reactive arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, celiac disease, and alopecia areata.
